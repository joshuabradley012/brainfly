"""Minimal end-to-end use of flybrain/reservoir.py, with synthetic data instead of a
game -- no recordings, no game logic, nothing task-specific. Shows the whole
loop: encoder -> frozen brain -> trace -> trained readout.

The task: on each of many trials, drive either the left or right chase
neurons (LC10a) at a random strength in [0.4, 1.0] for the whole trial. Two
readouts are trained on the resulting descending-neuron trace, averaged over
the trial: a classifier for "which side" (logistic) and a regressor for "how
strong" (ridge). Neither is hand-coded -- both are linear fits on the brain's
own activity, the kind of readout you would train on a real task, just on invented labels.

This does not prove anything about the fly connectome's suitability for
arbitrary tasks. It only
demonstrates that the module's API works end to end.
