"""Lab test: show the fly objects and measure its motor (descending) neurons.

Each condition runs 3 s of simulated time; rates are spikes/s per neuron,
averaged over the last 2 s. Answers: does anything on the screen actually
reach the neurons we'd use as game controls, and is it left/right specific?
