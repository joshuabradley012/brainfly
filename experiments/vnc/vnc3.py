"""Third VNC test, the first change to the model rather than a gain knob: a smaller time step.

vnc.py (uniform VNC tonic and gain, 0/20) and vnc2.py (gain on DN -> VNC and premotor -> MN,
0/12) could not make descending commands reach motor neurons without also driving them at rest. At
dt = 20 ms a spike needs a big share of a neuron's normalised input inside one step, so deep chains
fade. In a two-fly song experiment (since removed), dt = 2 ms with a 4 ms refractory period let signal cross chains that were silent
at 20 ms. This tests the unmodified connectome at:

  dt 20 ms, no refractory   (control: should fail as in vnc.py's first row)
  dt 5 ms,  refractory 4 ms
  dt 2 ms,  refractory 4 ms

FlyBrain rescales tonic so resting voltage matches the 20 ms model. DN drive is scaled by dt / 20 ms so
the voltage injected per second is the same; the DN rates reached are printed. Pass criteria are exactly
those of vnc.py (REST, COMMAND, DISTINCT, LATERAL), fixed before this run, over 1 s windows. A
passing setting (smallest change first: 5 ms before 2 ms) is re-run on fresh seeds with 8 flies and only
that confirmation counts.
